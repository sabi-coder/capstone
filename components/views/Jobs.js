          <h2>Security Software Developer</h2>
          <p>
            Security Software Developers build security software and integrate
            security into applications software during the design and
            development process. Depending on the specific position and company,
            a security software developer might oversee a team of developers in
            the creation of secure software tools, develop a company-wide
            software security strategy, participate in the lifecycle development
            of software systems, support software deployments to customers, and
            test their work for vulnerabilities.

          <h2>Security Architect</h2>
          <p>
            A security architect is meant to create, build and execute network
            and computer security for an organization. Security architects are
            responsible for developing complex security framework and ensuring
            that they function effectively. They design security systems to
            counter malware, hacking and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
            attacks.

          <h2>Security Consultant</h2>
          <p>
            A security consultant is a catch-all cybersecurity expert. They
            evaluate cybersecurity threats, risks, problems, and give possible
            solutions for different organizations and guide them in protecting
            and securing their physical capital and data. Security consultants
            must not be too rigid and must be tech-savvy — they deal with a wide
            range of variables when assessing security systems across diverse
            companies and industries.

          <h2>Information Security Analyst</h2>
          <p>
            Information Security Analysts are the front-line defense of
            networks, Information Security Analysts put firewalls and encryption
            in order to protect breaches, constantly monitor and audit systems
            for unusual activities.

        <div>
          <h2>Ethical Hacker</h2>
          <p>
            Ethical hackers normally hold a CEH certificate and are given
            license by their employers to try and infiltrate the security of
            their system. The idea is that they use the same techniques as
            malicious black hat hackers to test existing security protocols; if
            they are successful, upgrades can then be developed and implemented.

          <h2>Computer Forensics Analysts</h2>
          <p>
            Forensics analysts focus on cyber-crime, an ever-growing phenomenon.
            They work with law enforcement agencies in both public and private
            sector organizations and are asked to undertake a wide variety of
            tasks, including: • Recovering deleted files • Interpreting data
            linked to crime • Analyzing mobile phone records • Pursuing data
            trails Computer forensic analysts must keep a well — detailed
            records of their investigations, and often provide evidence in
            court.

        <div>
          <h2>Chief Information Security Officer</h2>
          <p>
            Chief Information Security Officer is normally a mid-executive level
            position whose job is to manage the affairs operations of a
            company’s or organization’s IT security division. Usually
            responsible for planning, coordinating and directing all computer,
            network and data security needs of their employers. CISOs work
            directly with management to determine an organization’s custom
            cybersecurity demands. The CISOs usually have the responsibility of
            assembling an effective staff of security professionals, which means
            that the position requires an individual with a strong background in
            IT security architecture and strategy, as well as effective
            communication and human resource skills.

        <div>
          <h2>Penetration Tester</h2>
          <p>
            Penetration testing is the proactive authorized employment of
            testing procedures on the IT system to identify system flaws. A
            penetration tester usually attempts to (with permission) hack into a
            computer and network systems to pre-emptively discover operating
            system vulnerabilities, service and application problems, improper
            configurations and more, before an intruder cause real damage.
            Penetration testers must be highly skilled, often using testing
            tools of their own design, to “break into” the systems under watch.
            Penetration testers are required to keep accurate records of their
            activities and discovered vulnerabilities.

          <h2>IT Security Consultant</h2>
          <p>
            IT security consultants meet with clients to advise them on how to
            protect their organizations’ cybersecurity objectives best
            efficiently and cost-effectively. IT Security Consultants are often
            employed by smaller firms and agencies that cannot afford to handle
            their security issues in-house but are also employed by big
            corporation to supplement their security teams and provide an
            impartial outside perspective to current systems challenges.

        <div>
          <h2>Security Systems Administration</h2>
          <p>
            A security systems administrator’s responsibility is a bit similar
            to many cybersecurity jobs i.e., installing, administering,
            maintaining and troubleshooting computer, network and data security
            systems. The main distinction between security systems
            administrators and other cybersecurity professionals is that the
            security systems administrator is normally the person in charge of
            the daily operation of those security systems. The regular tasks
            include systems monitoring and running regular backups, and setting
            up, deleting and maintaining individual user accounts. Security
            systems administrators are usually often involved in developing
            organizational security procedures.
