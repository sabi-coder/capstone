            Information security is the protection of internet-connected systems,
            including hardware, software and data, from cyberattacks. In a
            computing context, security comprises cybersecurity and physical
            security -- both are used by enterprises to protect against
            unauthorized access to data centers and other computerized systems.
            The term cybersecurity can be vague and not as helpful with someone
            starting a career in this field. We'll go into the categories of
            careers and a little about what each is responsible for.
